Amidst a midlife crossroads where some men might find solace in motorcycles, I've chosen a distinctive path – immersing myself in the intricate world of constructing and maintaining a Homelab. This specialized haven serves as a repository for my Homelab notes and ongoing projects.

Several years ago, a casual conversation with a coworker sparked my curiosity about the myriad services he hosted. Eager to explore, I delved into researching the mentioned services and concepts. Despite having a slightly above-average technological proficiency at the outset, navigating the complexities of Linux, Networking, and PC/Server Building posed a significant challenge. My background, rooted primarily in Cable TV installation and maintenance, presented a unique perspective, and the learning curve became notably steep, especially when confronted with the enigmatic unknown unknowns – the realm of "You don't know what you don't know."

Venturing into these unfamiliar territories and posing questions in such arenas can be daunting. However, the Homelab community has proven to be exceptionally patient and supportive, offering a reassuring backdrop to my explorations.

Unexpectedly, my niche hobby has not only provided personal fulfillment but has also unexpectedly advanced my career.
